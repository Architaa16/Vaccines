"Analyzing Differential Adverse Reactions among Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V Recipients: Insights from Machine Learning and Epidemiological Analysis"

# Vaccine Adverse Reaction Checker

This project provides a simple and direct way for users to check the potential adverse reactions they might experience based on their **age**, **gender**, and **vaccine type**. It uses a basic machine learning model trained on a CSV dataset to make predictions.

## 📝 Project Description

The idea behind this project is to help individuals get a quick overview of possible side effects from different vaccines. It does this by using a trained model on sample data. The interface is built using **Flask**, and the user inputs are collected via a form.

There is no complex frontend or database involved — the project is meant to be lightweight and focused on functionality.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. User enters:
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Vaccine Type (Covishield, Covaxin, etc.)
2. These inputs are fed into a pre-trained ML model.
3. The model returns a likely adverse reaction (e.g., Fever, Headache, None, etc.)
4. The result is displayed on a simple output page.
